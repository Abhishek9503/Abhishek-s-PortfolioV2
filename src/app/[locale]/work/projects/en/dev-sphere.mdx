## Overview

DevSphere is a modern, full-stack online IDE tailored for real-time, multi-language development in the browser. The app focuses on performance, developer experience, and extensibility — enabling users to write, execute, and share code in 10 different languages with a responsive and customizable interface.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Language Execution**: Supports 10 popular languages with seamless execution handling.
- **Theme Personalization**: Offers 5 beautiful VSCode-inspired themes.
- **Smart Output States**: Shows clear success or error messages after code execution.
- **Execution History**: Track your runs with detailed records in your personal profile.
- **Sharing & Collaboration**: Publicly share code snippets with rich filters and tags.
- **Webhook Integrations**: Enable CI, logging, or external automation workflows.
- **Custom Font & Layout**: Improve accessibility with adjustable font sizes and layout preferences.
- **Stats Dashboard**: Visualize usage metrics, most-run languages, and contributions.
- **Free & Pro Plans**: Stripe-powered flexible pricing model.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js 15 App Router**: Full-stack foundation with Server Components and Actions.
- **Convex**: Real-time backend for reactive storage and sync.
- **Clerk**: Authentication with Google, GitHub, and Passkeys.
- **Tailwind CSS 4 + Shadcn UI**: Styling and accessible UI components.
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and developer efficiency.
- **Stripe**: Handles payments, subscriptions, and webhook flows.

## Challenges and Learnings

Handling concurrent execution across multiple languages required thoughtful backend architecture and output state management. Integrating real-time data using Convex and building a flexible sharing system involved learning advanced indexing and reactive query optimization. Clerk authentication provided a solid foundation for building secure gated routes and account-level history tracking.

## Outcome

DevSphere provides a smooth, professional-grade coding experience with full-stack execution, personalization, and real-time features — all running in the browser. The project is production-deployed and demonstrates how modern technologies can be leveraged to create a truly interactive developer tool.
